# Literalization_with_Constraints
# - Basically a literalization test with some extra tricky stuff
# - Literalized equality test in conjunction, so test should be thrown out
# - Ungrounded equality test with constraints on it that use both literalized 
#   and variablized symbols.  One constraint should propagate and literalized 
#   one should be thrown out.
